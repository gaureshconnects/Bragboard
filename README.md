# Bragboard
BragBoard is an internal recognition tool for workplaces that lets employees appreciate their colleagues by posting shout-outs. It promotes a culture of appreciation by allowing tagging, commenting, and company-wide visibility. Admins can monitor engagement and moderate flagged content.
